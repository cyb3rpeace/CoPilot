## Getting started

Copilot's true power comes from the ability to integrate with your existing security stack. We have built in integrations with the following tools:

-   [Wazuh](https://wazuh.com/)
-   [Graylog](https://www.graylog.org/)
-   [DFIR-IRIS](https://dfir-iris.org/)
-   [Velociraptor](https://docs.velociraptor.app/)
-   [Grafana](https://grafana.com/)
-   [InfluxDB](https://www.influxdata.com/)

‚ùóÔ∏è **Note:** Copilot is currently in beta. We are actively working on adding more integrations and features. If you have any suggestions or feedback, please let us know!

### Running Copilot

To ease the installation and upgrades, Copilot is shipped in a single docker container. To run Copilot, you will need to have [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/) installed.

‚ùó **WARNING:** Copilot is not intended to be exposed to the internet. It is recommended for internal use only.

üî¥ - Helpful docker DNS setting

```
nano /etc/docker/daemon.json
```

```json
{ "dns": ["YOUR_DNS_SERVER"], "log-driver": "json-file", "log-opts": { "max-size": "10m", "max-file": "3" } }
```

```
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl restart docker
```

---

```bash
#  Clone the CoPilot repository
git clone https://github.com/socfortress/CoPilot
cd CoPilot

# Copy the environment file
cp .env.example .env

# Make your changes to the .env file

# Build the copilot-frontend image
bash build-dockers.sh

# Run Copilot
docker compose up -d
```

Copilot shall be available on the host interface, port 443, protocol HTTPS - `https://<your_instance_ip>`.
By default, an `admin` account is created. The password is printed in stdout the very first time Copilot is started. It won't be printed anymore after that.
`Admin user password` can be searched in the logs of the `copilot` docker to find the password. You will use the `plain` password to login to the web interface.

### Upgrading Copilot

üõ† You will likely want to upgrade often as we are frequently pushing new changes.

To upgrade Copilot, you will need to stop the running container, pull the latest docker image, and start the container again.

```bash
# Stop the running container. Make sure you are in the CoPilot directory
docker compose down

# Pull the latest docker image
docker pull ghcr.io/socfortress/copilot:latest

# Start the container again
docker compose up -d
```

## Connectors

Copilot is designed to be a single pane of glass for your security operations. Think of it as a hub for all your security tools. Copilot Connectors are the glue that binds your security tools to Copilot. We take advantage of the APIs and webhooks provided by your security tools to provide a seamless integration.
