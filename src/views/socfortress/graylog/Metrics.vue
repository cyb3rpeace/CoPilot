		Graylog metrics detail the current load or backlog of logs being processed by the Graylog server. Also in this
		payload is the
		<code>uncommitted_journal_entries</code>
		. If this value is greater than
		<code>50,000</code>
		I'd like for that to be
		<strong>highlighted</strong>
		on the page as an issue.
